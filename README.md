## Instructions on how to run the application locally 📝

- 1️⃣ Clone the repository to your machine if you have the access. Use this link to do it.
- 2️⃣ Open the project in vs code and create a file named .env.local in the root of the folder.
- 3️⃣ Add the code bellow in the .env.local file

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://smart-phone-server-three.vercel.app/api/
VITE_IMGBB_API_KEY=""
```

- 4️⃣ Open the command prompt on the project path or terminal on the vs code by pressing Ctrl + `
- 5️⃣ Run the command 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install all the necessary dependencies.
- 6️⃣ To run the application on <http://localhost:5173>, run the command 'npm run dev'. if the application is running, you will see the login page on the localhost.

- 7️⃣ use the credentials to login

```
<!-- for admin -->

<!-- for manager -->

<!-- for user -->
email :user@gmail.com
